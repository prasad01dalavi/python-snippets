Steps:
1. Write your code. I have saved it as myCode.py
2. Write a program which will make mycode executable. I have written it in myCodeExe.py
3. Open cmd at the folder in which these two files are located.
4. Give command "python myCodeExe.py build"
5. In build folder I will get my executable file.

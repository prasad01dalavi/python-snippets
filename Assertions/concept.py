"""
An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off
when you are done with your testing of the program.
The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a raise-if statement
(or to be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested,
and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised.
